# cis-498
This is the final project for class in CIS 498. The final result is a bit messy. There is a known error dislaying some of 
the queries on the course schedule.

The project was turned in on 6/2/15. With the exception of the aforementioned bug, we met the requirements for the project
and scored the highest in the class.

There were 4 other individuals who contributed to this project, but we did not use version control through git. This is the 
final product as-is when we turned it in. 

The majority of the frontend work was my own. I did not work on the backend of this program.

This serves as an example of my understanding of MVC programing.
