# CIS-498
9/15/2015
This is the final project for class in CIS 498. The final result is a bit messy. There is a known error dislaying some of 
the queries on the course schedule.

The project was turned in on 6/2/15. With the exception of the aforementioned bug, we met the requirements for the project
and scored the highest in the class.

There were 4 other individuals who contributed to this project, but we did not use version control through git. This is the 
final product as-is when we turned it in. 

The majority of the frontend work was my own. I did not work on the backend of this program.

This serves as an example of my understanding of MVC programing.

## Running the program
The build and installtion of this proect was dependent upon NetBeans (8.0). NetBeans offers a built-in derby database. If you do not use netbeans, you must set up the database accordingly. You must load the database data (via the sql file) if you wish to give the program a test-drive and see sample data.

The Java files within the plutoSched folder must have the paths changed in order to work properly. The paths were dependent upon the developer's computer.

This program is provided as-is with known bugs and not fully optimized. I offer no support. There is a posibility that I will come back and work to clean up the project, but no development is scheduled at this time.
